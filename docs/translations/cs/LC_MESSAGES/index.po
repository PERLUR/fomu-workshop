"Hi, I’m Fomu! This workshop covers the basics of Fomu in a top-down "
"approach. We’ll start out by learning what Fomu is, how to load software "
"into Fomu, and finally how to write software for Fomu."

"FPGAs are complex, weird things, so we’ll take a gentle approach and "
"start out by treating it like a Python interpreter first, and gradually "
"peel away layers until we’re writing our own hardware registers. You can "
"take a break at any time and explore! Stop when you feel the concepts are"
" too unfamiliar, or plough on and dig deep into the world of hardware."
