"LiteX used as the soft SoC on Fomu is a very robust and scalable soft SoC"
" platform, capable of running both bare metal binaries, Zephyr and even "
"Linux."
msgstr ""

#: ../../renode.rst:8
msgid ""
"It is also supported in `Renode <https://renode.io>`__, which is an open "
"source simulation framework that lets you run unmodified software in a "
"fully controlled and inspectable environment. Renode is a functional "
"simulator, which means it aims to mimic the observable behavior of the "
"hardware instead of trying to be cycle-accurate."

"We will now see how a full-blown Zephyr RTOS can be run on LiteX in "
"Renode, and then how this simulation can be interfaced with a Fomu for a "
"useful HW/SW co-development workflow."

"Apart from RISC-V and LiteX platforms, Renode supports many other "
"architectures and platforms, as described in the `documentation "
"<https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/supported-"
"boards.html>`__, which also includes a user manual and a few tutorials. "
"You can also take a look at a `Video Tutorials section on Renode’s "
"website <https://renode.io/tutorials/>`__."

"Keep in mind that all platforms and configurations in Renode used in this"
" tutorial are contained in text/config files - you can also explore "
"Renode’s usage patterns by just inspecting those files for details."
